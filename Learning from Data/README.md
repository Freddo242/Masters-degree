# Correlation and Regression README

## General overview

The coursework set for us for Learning From Data gave us 5 datasets to pick from which we were required to apply models that we had learning in the lectures. 
Having timeseries financial data, and with some knowldege of technical market analysis, I chose to explore how regression models were affected by different data features, which were different financial indicators.
You'll find my report and commented code in this repository.
